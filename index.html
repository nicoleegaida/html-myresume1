<h2>About me... :)</h2> 
</font>
<font color="GREY">
<p>
    I am 22 years old, studying Finance Management and Accounting. 
    I began my professional career as an accountant while still at university. 
    However, after two years, 
    I realized that this work no longer brings me satisfaction. 
    So, I've decided to explore something new—coding. 
    I'm just at the beginning of this journey, 
    but I hope it's the right path for me, 
    something that will bring me joy.
